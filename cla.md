### Corning Individual Contributor License Agreement

In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, Corning Inc ("Corning") must have a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA" or “Agreement”) on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of Corning; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to Corning. Except for the license granted herein to Corning and recipients of software distributed by Corning, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.
1.	Definitions.

    "You" (or "Your") shall mean the individual that is making this Agreement with Corning. 

    "Contribution" shall mean the code, documentation or any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to Corning for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by Corning (the "Work"). For the purposes of this Agreement, "submitted" and “submit” means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Corning or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Corning for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

2.	Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Corning and to recipients of software distributed by Corning a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

3.	Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Corning and to recipients of software distributed by Corning a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. 

4.	You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license. If your employer(s) or any other person has otherwise engaged you (e.g. an organization that has engaged you under a contractor relationship), has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer or person, that your employer or that person has waived such rights for your Contributions to Corning, or that your employer or that person has executed a separate Corporate CLA with Corning.

5.	You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others). 

6.	You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON- INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

7.	Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to Corning separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which you are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as "Submitted on behalf of a third-party: [named here]".

8.	You agree to notify Corning of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make the representations in this Agreement inaccurate in any respect.

9.	You agree to do such things and execute such documents as may be reasonably to confirm the rights granted to us under this Agreement, including, if required, signing a physical version of this Agreement.
